# OS-Scripts-Install
These is just a personal things that I like to do everythime I install windows in a personall system, thats all, give it a look if you want.
It would first be for windows, I may add some of my linux(I already did with fedora, maybe I would add Ubuntu) and mac systems personalized as my likeness
I tried using these debloater https://github.com/Raphire/Win11Debloat in my .bat for windows but It didnt worked, so I have it here now.
